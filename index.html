          <b>Overview: </b> Climate change, primarily driven by greenhouse gas
          emissions, has already started to noticably impact our world, and
          there is no sign of it slowing down in the near future. We aim to
          investigate both the causes and the effects of this pressing global
          issue through our narrative.

          <h3>
            The industrial age marked a new era — not just for humans with their
            technological advancements, but also for Earth itself with the start
            of environmental pollution at scale. The release of toxic greenhouse
            gases into the atmosphere has affected all aspects of the biosphere.
            In recent years, we have been made increasingly aware of these
            effects on our day-to-day lives. Global temperatures have soared to
            new highs and we have seen unprecedented weather activity around the
            world.

            This shift in our environment is referred to as
            <b>climate change</b>, and is considered to be humanity's greatest
            threat. Yet, as big of an issue as climate change is regarded to be,
            there are those who do not believe in its effects on our planet. In
            a study conducted by Yale University in 2021, ~71.8% of Americans
            believed in climate change, while ~14.5% of American did not believe
            that climate change was real.
          </h3>
          <h3>
            This lack of consensus has made climate change a politically charged
            topic, and thus one that humanity has been very slow to act upon due
            to modern bureaucracy.
          </h3>
        </div>
        <div id="div3">
          <h3>
            Despite those who do not believe in climate change, data collected
            by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has
            showed an increase in storm frequency since 1955.
          </h3>
          <h3>
            Alongside any material and environmental damage of more violent
            storms, increased global temperatures have led to the destruction of
            critical environments such as the Great Barrier Reef in Australia.
          </h3>
          <h3>
            Given the historical data that we now possess, we can establish that
            climate change is a real issue that has real effects. How did it
            become such a large problem, and why has it not been solved yet?
          </h3>
        </div>
        <div id="div4">
          <h3>
            A cause of the climate change is the climbing global temperatures as
            a result in increased amounts of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere.
            These greenhouse gases trap light from the sun in our atmosphere,
            resulting in the gasees trapping heat as well, causing the warming
            affect we see in the global rising temperatures.
          </h3>
          <h3>
            The primary greenhouse gas emitted by humans is CO₂, this being that
            our breath results in the production of CO₂ as well the burning of
            fossil fuels for energy production and transportation. This results
            in CO₂ accounting for almost

              80% of the U.S. greenhouse gas emissions in 2020</a
            >.

          <h3>
            Carbon dioxide makes up the overwhelming majority of greenhouse gas
            emissions (about 79%), but it is not the only greenhouse gas that we
            need to worry about. Other gasses, such as methane and nitrous
            oxide, are also large contributors to climate change.
          </h3>
          <h3>
            Methane, which is produced during the production and transport of
            coal, natural gas, and oil, currently accounts for about 11% of
            greenhouse gas emissions in the United States. It is also emitted by
            livestock and from other farming practices as well as from the
            decomposition of organic waste, such as in landfills. While this gas
            is not nearly as prevalent as carbon dioxide, it has a higher Global
            Warming Potential (GWP) of 27, which means that it absorbs roughly
            27 times more gas over time than an equivalent amount of carbon
            dioxide, and therefore also contributes more to global warming than
            its relatively small percentage of total emissions might suggest.
          </h3>
          <h3>
            Nitrous oxide is a byproduct of many industrial and agricultural
            processes, as well as from burning fossil fuels, and makes up around
            7% of the total greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. Its GWP is even
            higher than methane, causing it to absorb around 273 times as much
            gas as an equivalent amount of carbon dioxide. Because of this,
            while carbon dioxide is certainly an important gas to try to reduce
            emissions of, it is also important to try and reduce the emissions
            of other greenhouse gasses that can be just as damaging to the
            environment.

          <h3>
            Unfortunately, reducing greenhouse gas emissions is not as simple as
            telling countries to outlaw harmful processes. The graph on the left
            charts countries by their Human Development Index (HDI). For many
            undeveloped countries, nonrenewable energy sources are their only
            reliable way of powering the grid, and they may not have the
            financial capacity to focus on renewable energy.
          </h3>

          <h3>
            On the other end of the spectrum, developed countries tend to have a
            large population of citizens, and thus a large demand for energy.
            Because renewable sources of energy are intermittent (and do not run
            continuously), satisfying 100% of the energy demand is not feasible
            with current technology, and thus a reliance also exists on
            nonrenewable sources to fill the gap.
          </h3>
        </div>
        <div id="div7">
          <h3>
            While countries may grow in population linearly, their energy and
            resource demands increase exponentially. The modern infrastructure
            and supply chain does not exist to enable renewable energy as the
            sole provider of energy going forwards, so currently supply falls
            back on nonrenewable energy to fill in the quota. Thus, large
            countries face the problem of having to replace a deeply-baked (and
            continuously growing) nonrenewable power grid with a renewable
            solution, while the cost of replacement grows exponentially with the
            size and demand of the grid.
          </h3>
          <h3>
            The visualization on the left compares the GDP, population, and
            total CO2 emissions for each country in 2018. Clicking on a bubble
            focuses on the sources of CO2 emissions for that country.
          </h3>
          <h3>
            Energy demand is not the only contributing factor to increased
            emissions in large countries. The widespread usage of concrete in
            developed countries has led to cement being one of the largest
            contributors to global CO2 emissions. Additionally, increase in
            material demand has created an economic reliance on factories which
            release harmful and toxic gases as part of the manufacturing
            process.
          </h3>
          <h3>
            Climate change cannot be solved with a "eureka" moment, it is a
            complex and challenging societal issue that will take decades of
            fighting to overcome. As the effects of climate change become more
            impactful on our day-to-day lives, more global attention will be
            focused on the issue (and thus more resources will be committed
            towards working on a solution). In the years to come, renewable
            energy sources such as nuclear fusion may be proven to be viable,
            and global restrictions could be set in place to cap the amount of
            regulated emissions per country.
